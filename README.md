# Colorimetric-Chlorine-Detection
This repo contains all my progress updates and code for my research project - colorimetric chlorine detection and automation

## Aim - 
  1. To create and automate a way to detect ppm concentration of chlorine in a sample.
  2. To automate the process with an LED/LDR combination with a microprocessor. 
  3. To automate dispensing of the required powder with servos and a microprocessor.
